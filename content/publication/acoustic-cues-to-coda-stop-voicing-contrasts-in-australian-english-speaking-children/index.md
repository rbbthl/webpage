abstract: While voicing contrasts in word-onset position are acquired relatively
  early, much less is known about how and when they are acquired in word-coda
  position, where accurate production of these contrasts is also critical for
  distinguishing words (e.g., dog vs. dock). This study examined how the
  acoustic cues to coda voicing contrasts are realized in the speech of
  4-year-old Australian English-speaking children. The results showed that
  children used similar acoustic cues to those of adults, including longer vowel
  duration and more frequent voice bar for voiced stops, and longer closure and
  burst durations for voiceless stops along with more frequent irregular pitch
  periods. This suggests that 4-year-olds have acquired productive use of the
  acoustic cues to coda voicing contrasts, though implementations are not yet
  fully adult-like. The findings have implications for understanding the
  development of phonological contrasts in populations for whom these may be
  challenging, such as children with hearing loss.
