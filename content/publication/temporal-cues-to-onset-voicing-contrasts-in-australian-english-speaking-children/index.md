abstract: Voicing contrasts are lexically important for differentiating words in
  many languages (e.g., “bear” vs “pear”). Temporal differences in the voice
  onset time (VOT) and closure duration (CD) contribute to the voicing contrast
  in word-onset position. However, little is known about the acoustic
  realization of these voicing contrasts in Australian English-speaking
  children. This is essential for understanding the challenges faced by those
  with language delay. Therefore, the present study examined the VOT and CD
  values for word-initial stops as produced by 20 Australian English-speaking
  4–5-year-olds. As anticipated, these children produced a systematic
  distinction between voiced and voiceless stops at all places of articulation
  (PoAs). However, although the children's VOT values for voiced stops were
  similar to those of adults, their VOTs for voiceless stops were longer. Like
  adults, the children also had different CD values for voiced and voiceless
  categories; however, these were systematically longer than those of adults.
  Even after adjusting for temporal differences by computing proportional ratios
  for the VOT and CD, children's voicing contrasts were not yet adult-like.
  These results suggest that children of this age are still developing
  appropriate timing and articulatory adjustments for voicing contrasts in the
  word-initial position.
