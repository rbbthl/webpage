  Purpose: Children with hearing loss (HL), including those with hearing aids
  (HAs) and cochlear implants (CIs), often have difficulties contrasting words
  like “beach” versus “peach” and “dog” versus “dock” due to challenges
  producing systematic voicing contrasts. Even when acoustic contrasts are
  present, these may not be perceived as such by others. This can cause
  miscommunication, leading to poor self-esteem and social isolation. Acoustic
  evidence is therefore needed to determine if these children have established
  distinct voicing categories before entering school and if misperceptions are
  due to a lack of phonological representations or due to a still-maturing
  implementation system. The findings should help inform more effective early
  intervention.


  Method: Participants included 14 children with HL (eight HA users, five CI users, and one bimodal) and 20 with normal hearing, all English-speaking preschoolers. In an elicited imitation task, they produced consonant–vowel–consonant minimal pair words that contrasted voicing in word-initial (onset) or word-final (coda) position at all three places of articulation (PoAs).


  Results: Overall, children with HL showed acoustically distinct voicing categories for both onsets and codas at all three PoAs. Contrasts were less systematic for codas than for onsets, as also confirmed by adults' perceptual ratings.


  Conclusions: Preschoolers with HL produce acoustic differences for voiced versus voiceless onsets and codas, indicating distinct phonological representations for both. Nonetheless, codas were less accurately perceived by adult raters, especially when produced by CI users. This suggests a protracted development of the phonetic implementation of codas, where CI users, in particular, may benefit from targeted intervention.
